Everything found in this folder was created during a semester project for a master's class and is kept mainly as a 
reference. An explanation of the idea behind the framework and what the full goal of the project is can be found in 
the included white paper. 

I have to apologize for the lack of thorough documentation as I knew I would be improving upon the current set up and 
mainly used this as personal code.
